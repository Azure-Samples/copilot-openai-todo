# ðŸ¤– copilot-openai-todo

This project is an example Todo app implementation, that aims to showcase how to use [GitHub Copilot](https://copilot.github.com/) to build an AI-powered todo app using [Azure OpenAI](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/ai-services/openai-service) and [Azure Cosmos DB](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cosmos-db/).

**The completed application is located in the [completed branch](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/copilot-openai-todo/tree/completed).**

## Prerequisites
- **Node.js v18+**
- **Docker v20+**
- **Azure account**. If you're new to Azure, [get an Azure account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=javascript-0000-yolasors) to get free Azure credits to get started.
- **Azure subscription with access enabled for the Azure OpenAI service**. You can request access with [this form](https://aka.ms/oaiapply).
  * Alternatively, you can use an [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/authentication) instead of the Azure OpenAI service.

You can use [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) to work on this project directly from your browser: select the **Code** button, then the **Codespaces** tab and click on **Create Codespaces on main**.

You can also use the [Dev Containers extension for VS Code](https://aka.ms/vscode/ext/devcontainer) to work locally using a ready-to-use dev environment.

After you cloned or opened the project in your dev environment, run the following command to install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Project details

This project is structured as monorepo and makes use of [NPM Workspaces](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/using-npm/workspaces). It's organized as follows:

```sh
.devcontainer/    # Dev container configuration
.github/          # GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
packages/         # The different parts of our app
|- server/        # The Express server, hosting the API and the website
+- client/        # The website client
package.json      # NPM workspace configuration
```

## How to build the project

```bash
npm run build
```

This command will build the client and server packages.

## How to setup deployment

To provision the resources on Azure and deploy the services, we use the [Azure Dev CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/).

```bash
# Only needed once
azd auth login --use-device-code

# Provision and deploy infrastructure
azd up
```

You can also provision and deploy the infrastructure separately:

```bash
# Provision infrastructure
azd provision

# Deploy infrastructure
azd deploy
```

## How to run locally

In order to run the application locally, you'll need to setup the following environment variables in a `.env` file at the root of the project with the following content:

```sh
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=<your Azure OpenAI endpoint>
AZURE_COSMOS_DB_ENDPOINT=<your Azure Cosmos DB endpoint>
```

As the application rely on Azure services for the OpenAI completions and Cosmos DB storage, you'll need to provision these resources on Azure first (see [How to setup deployment](#how-to-setup-deployment)).

Then, run the following commands to generate your `.env` file:
```bash
azd env get-values > .env
```

Once your `.env` file is ready, you can start the application by running the following command at the root of the project:

```bash
npm run start
```

This will run both the client and server:
- The client will be available at http://localhost:4200.
- The server will be available at http://localhost:3000.

# Demo scenario

Time: 30min

Yohan, the newest addition to Contoso's AI team, brings a fresh perspective to the company's digital journey. His inaugural mission is both ambitious and exciting: to breathe new life into a legacy to-do app. Yohan aims to infuse this app with the power of Generative AI, making it more attuned to the needs of today's customers. While Yohan possesses some knowledge of OpenAI on Azure and CosmosDB, he's not yet an expert in these domains. To bridge the gap, he's placing his trust in GitHub Copilot, an innovative AI-driven coding companion.  

As he dives into the world of AI-infused applications, the suspense lingersâ€”will Yohan succeed, and will Copilot be the ace up his sleeve? 

## Demo plan

### Preparation
- Open Codespaces on this repo: https://github.com/sinedied/copilot-openai-todo => `feat-ai` branch
  * Use GH white theme
  * Close every VS code tab except README.md
  * Check that Copilot, Chat and REST client extension have loaded
- Open https://github.com/microsoft/TypeChat (then https://github.com/microsoft/TypeChat/blob/main/examples/sentiment/src/main.ts)

### Intro

- Explain the context:
  * I joined this new team working on modernizing a legacy app. Well, you all know how it is, right?
  * This app is nothing too fancy: it's a todo app. And I was asked to add some AI to it, as you've seen the trend lately.
  * I was told that this project was using JavaScript and Azure, but besides that, I don't know much about it.

- First, I'll use Codespaces to have a ready-to-use dev environment.
  * You can use it either from your browser or from VS Code.
  * ! Show devcontainer.json and explain dev container configuration

- Copilot in VS Code comes in different forms and at different places, as you'll see along the demo.
  * Here, I'm using the Copilot chat extension, which is nowadays my preferred way to use Copilot to interact with my code.

### Project insights

- @workspace what's the stack used in this project?
  * @workspace what's the stack of the server?

### Infrastructure

- main.bicep
  * how can I avoid passing secrets key as env variables?

- prepare infrastructure
  * open README :)
  * azd auth login --use-device-code
  * azd provision
    * ai-todo
    * 34. west-europe

### Server side

- app.ts
  * refactor to use import

- create an OpenAiService class that:
  * use @azure/identity to retrieve Azure credentials
  * get openAI token from credentials

- fix the token scope to use Azure openAI
  * must be 'https://cognitiveservices.azure.com/.default'

! Story
* So now that I'm able to get a token, I can use it to call the OpenAI API.
* I've heard about this new lib TypeChat, that is supposed to help me with adding AI to my app without having to know much about AI.
* The question is: what to use AI for? The boring part of any todo app, is well, entering tasks. So I'll use AI to as a task planner that will create the tasks for me.

- DO MANUALLY: create service/planner.ts
  * export class TaskPlannerService { }
  * use Copilot: static getInstance(): 
    => ! This is the regular Copilot experience, where it suggests a completion as you type.
  * complete instance method
  * add async init() method
    * // Initialize the OpenAI service
    * this.openAiService = await OpenAiService.getInstance();
  * fix with Copilot (change to async)
    * add aync manually  

! Go to TypeChat website and open examples/sentiment
  * Show schema and explain how it works

- DO MANUALLY: Create task-planner-schema.ts
  * export interface TaskPlanner {}
  * // This file defines the schema for splitting a target goal into tasks needed to achieve the goal.
  * // For example, if the goal is to "Plan a trip to Paris", the tasks could be:
  * // Tasks needed to be done to achieve the goal

! Explain the importance of context when using Copilot:
  * The open tabs
  * The clipboard
  * The current file

- Go back to planner.ts
  * ! I need to init Typechat, but it's too recent to have data for it, so let's help it a bit.
  * ! Copy paste code from example in the file and comment it
  * add
    * async planTasks(goal: string): Promise<TaskPlanner> {
  * // Get the OpenAI token
  * // Initr TypeChat
  *   OPENAI_API_KEY: openAiToken,
      OPENAI_ENDPOINT: process.env.AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT,
      OPENAI_MODEL: process.env.AZURE_OPENAI_CHATGPT_MODEL || "gpt-35-turbo",
  * complete
    * const schema =
    * const translator
    * const response = 
    * if (!response.success) {
    * return response.data

- Complete the route, open `root.ts`
  * grab body param: const { useAiPlanner } = req.body;
  * complete:
    if (useAiPlanner) {
      const planner = await TaskPlannerService.getInstance();
      const plan = await planner.planTasks(task.title);
      const tasks = plan.tasks.map(task => ({
        title: task,
        userId,
        completed: false
      }));
      const createdTasks = [];
      for (const task of tasks) {
        await DbService.getInstance().createTask(task);
        createdTasks.push(task);
      }
      res.json(createdTasks);
  ! But using await in a loop is not a good idea, so let's fix that.
  * Optimize this code

- Run the server and test the code
  * azd env get-values > .env
  * npm start

### frontend side

- /explain angular bindings
 * what is $event?

- Open task-add.component.ts
  * add a checkbox input to enable AI planner
    * I want it below the container and with a label
  * create toggleAiPlanner() method
    * this.enableAiPlanner = input.checked
  * add enableAiPlanner
  * complete AddTask model to add useAiPlanner
  * add useAiPlanner to addTask() method

- open app.component.ts
  * 

- Generate a commit message for my changes
  * use conventional commits

### GitHub Actions

- create a github actions for a CI that runs my tests using Node 18
  * Can you make it so the tests run on Windows, Linux and Mac?

### (New component: if extra time)

- how can I create a new component with the angular CLI?
  * what if I don't want to create a new directory?

### Show final result

- `azd deploy`

- In the meantime, show how to translate db.ts to Python
  * convert to Python

- open browser and show deployed app
